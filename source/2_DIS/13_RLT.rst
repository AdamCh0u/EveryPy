Problems and Pain
========================
Life is difficult.
This is a great truth, one of the greatest truth.
The first of "Four Noble Truths" which Buddha taught was "Life is suffering".

人生苦难重重。
这是个伟大的真理，是世界上最伟大的真理之一。

It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult--once we truly understand and accept it--then life is no longer difficult. Beacuse once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

它的伟大，在于我们一旦想通了它，就能实现人生的超越。只要我们知道人生是艰难的———只要我们真正理解并接受这一点，那么我们就再也不会对人生的苦难耿耿于怀了。因为一旦它被接受，生活困难这个事实就不再重要了

Most do not see this truth that life is difficult. Instead they moan more or less incessantly, noisily or subtly, about the enormity of their problems, their burdens, and their difficulties as if life were generally easy, as if life should be easy. They voice their belief, noisily or subtly, that their difficulties represent a unique kind of affliction that should not be and that has some how been especially visited upon them, or else upon their families, their tribe, their class, their nation, their race or even their species, and not upon others. I know about theis moaning because I have done my share.

然而，大部分人却不愿正视它。他们不是怨天尤人，就是抱怨自己生而不幸，他们总是哀叹无数麻烦、压力、困难与其为伴，他们认为自己是世界上最不幸的人，在他们看来，似乎人生本该既舒适又顺利。他们表达他们的坚信，吵闹的或巧妙地，他们的困难代表一种独特的苦难本不该出现，但是命运偏偏让他们自己、他们的家人、他们的部落、他们的社会阶级、他们的国家和民族乃至他们的人种吃苦受罪———我熟悉类似的抱怨和诅咒，因为我也曾有过同样的感受。

Life is a series of problems. Do we want to moan about them or solve them？ Do we want to teach out children to solve them?
人生是一连串的难题，面对它，你是哭哭啼啼，还是勇敢奋起？你是束手无策地哀叹，还是积极地想方设法解决问题，并慷慨地将方法传给后人呢？

Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With only some discipline we can solve only some problems. With total dicipline we can solve all problems.
解决人生问题的首要方案，乃是自律，缺少了这一环，你不可能解决任何麻烦和困难。局部的自律只能解决局部的问题，完整的自律才能解决所有的问题。

What makes life difficult is that the process of confronting and solving problems is a painful one. Problems, depending upon their nature, evoke in us frustration or grief or sadness or loneliness or guilt or regret or anger or fear or anxiety or anguish or despair. Their are uncomfortable feelings, often very uncomfortable, often as painful as any kind of physical pain, sometimes equaling the very worst kind of physical pain. Indeed, it is because of the pain that events or conflicts engender in us all that we call them problems. And since life poses an endless series of problems, life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy.

生活之所以困难，是因为面对和解决问题的过程是痛苦的。问题的性质不同，会唤起我们沮丧、悲伤、悲伤、孤独、内疚、后悔、愤怒、恐惧、焦虑、痛苦或绝望的感觉。心灵之痛，通常和肉体之痛一样剧烈，甚至更加难以承受。事实上，正是因为事件或冲突在我们身上产生的痛苦，我们才称之为问题。正是因为各种问题接踵而来，我们才觉得人生苦难重重，悲喜参半。

Yet it is in this whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning. Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure. Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom; indeed, they create our courage and our wisdom. It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually. When we desire to encourage the growth of the human spirit, we challenge and encourage the human capacity to solbe problems, just as in school we deliberatly set problems for our children to solve. It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn. As Benjamin Franklin said, "Those things that hurts, instruct." It is for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems and actully to welcome the pain of problems.

人生在一个面对问题并解决问题的过程中有了意义。问题能启发我们的智慧，激发我们的勇气；问题是我们成功与失败的分水岭。困难激发我们的勇气和智慧;事实上，它们创造了我们的勇气和智慧。正是因为这些问题，我们的精神和精神才得以成长。当我们想要鼓励人类精神的成长时，我们挑战并鼓励人类解决问题的能力，就像在学校里我们故意为我们的孩子设置问题来解决一样。正是通过直面和解决问题的痛苦，我们才得以学习。正如本杰明·富兰克林(BenjaminFranklin)所说:“惟有痛苦才会带来教益。”面对问题，聪明者不因害怕痛苦而选择逃避，而是迎上前去，直至将其战胜为止。

Most of us are not so wise. Fearing the pain involved, almost all of us, to a greater or lesser degree, attempt to avoid problems. We procrastinate, hoping that they will go away. We ignore them, forget them, so that by deadening ourselves to the pain we can forget the problems that cause the pain. We attempt to skirt around problems rather than meet them head on. We attempt to get out of them rather than suffer through them.

我们大多数人都不那么聪明。几乎我们所有人，或多或少，都因害怕所涉及的痛苦而试图避免问题。我们拖延，希望它们会消失。我们忽略他们，忘记他们，这样通过麻木我们自己的痛苦，我们可以忘记引起痛苦的问题。我们试图回避问题，而不是直接面对问题。我们试图摆脱它们，而不是忍受它们。

This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness. Since most of us have this tendency to a greater or lesser degree, most of us are mentally ill to a greater or lesser degree, lacking complete mental health. Some of us will go to quite extraodinary lengths to avoid out problems and the suffering they cause, proceeding far afield from all that is clearly good and sensible in order to try to find an easy way out, building the most elaborate fantasies in which to live, sometimes to the total exclusion of reality. In the succinctly elegeant words of Carl Jung, "Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering."

规避问题和逃避痛苦的趋向，是人类心理疾病的根源。人人都有逃避问题的倾向，因此大多数人的心理健康都存在缺陷，真正的健康者寥寥无几。有的逃避问题者，宁可躲藏在头脑营造的虚幻世界里，甚至完全与现实脱节，这无异于作茧自缚。心理学大师荣格更是明确地指出：“神经症，是人生痛苦常见的替代品。”

But the substitute itself ultimately becomes more painful than the legitimate suffering it was designed to avoid. The neurosis itself becomes the biggest problem. True to form, many will then attempt to avoid this pain and this problem in turn, building layer upon layer of neuroses and begin -- usually with the helo og psychotherapy -- to learn how to experience legitimate suffering. In any case, when we avoid the legitimate suffering that results from dealing with problems, we also avoid the growth that problems demand from us. It is for the reason that in chronic mental illness we stop growing, we become stuck. And without healing, the human spirit begins to shrivel.

替代品带来的痛苦，甚至比逃避的痛苦更为强烈，神经症由此成了更棘手的问题。不少人为逃避新的问题和痛苦，不断以神经官能症为替代品，导致患上各种心理疾病。所幸也有人能坦然面对神经官能症，及时寻求心理医生帮助，以正确的心态面对人生正常的痛苦。事实上，如果不顾一切地逃避问题和痛苦，就会由此失去以解决问题推动心灵成长的契机，导致心理疾病越来越严重，而长期的、慢性的心理疾病，就会使人的心灵停止生长。不及时治疗，心灵就会萎缩和退化，心智就永远难以成熟。

Therefore let us inculcate in ourselves and in our children the means of achieving mental and spiritual health. By this I mean let us teach ourselves and our children the necessity for suffering and the value thereof, the need to face problems directly and to experience the pain involved. I have stated that discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. It will become clear that these tools are techniques of suffering, means by which we experience the pain of problems in such a way as to work them through and solve them successfully, learning and growing in the process. When we teach ourselves and our children discipline, we are teaching them and ourselves how to suffer and also how to grow.

因此，让我们向我们自己和我们的孩子灌输达到精神和精神健康的方法,人生的问题和痛苦具有非凡的价值。勇于承担责任，敢于面对困难，才能够使心灵变得健康。自律，是解决人生问题的首要工具，也是消除人生痛苦的重要手段。我的意思是，让我们教导自己和我们的孩子受苦的必要性及其价值，直接面对问题和经历相关痛苦的必要性。我已经说过，自律是我们解决生活问题的基本工具。很明显，这些工具是痛苦的技巧，是我们体验问题的痛苦的方式，从而解决问题并成功地解决问题，在这个过程中学习和成长。我们教育自己和孩子自律，也是在教育我们双方如何忍受痛苦，获得成长。

What are these tools, these techniques of suffering, these means of experiencing the pain of problems constructively that I call discipline? There are four: delaying of gratificaiton, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing. As will be evident, there are not complex tools whose application demands entensive training, To the contrary, they are simpel tools. and almost all children are adept in their use by the age of ten. Yet presidents and kings will often forget to use them, to their own downfall. The problem lies not in the complexity of these tools but in the will to use them. For they are tools with which pain is confronted rather than avoided, and if one seeks to avoid legitimate suffering, then one will avoid the use of these tools. Therefore, after analyzing each of these tools, we shall in the next section examine the will to use them, which is love.

这些工具，这些折磨的技巧，这些建设性地体验问题痛苦的方法我称之为自律的是什么?所谓自律，是以积极而主动的态度，去解决人生痛苦的重要原则，主要包括四个方面：推迟满足感、承担责任、尊重事实、保持平衡。它们并不复杂，不过要想正确地运用它们，你需要细心体会，广泛实践。它们其实相当简单，即便是十岁的小孩，也能够最终掌握。不过有时候，即使贵为一国之君，也会因忽略和漠视它们而遭到报复，自取灭亡。实践这些原则，关键在于你的态度，你要敢于面对痛苦而非逃避。对于时刻想着逃避痛苦的人，这些原则不会起到任何作用，他们也绝不会从自律中获益。接下来，我要对这几种原则深入阐述，然后再探讨它们背后的原动力———爱。

Delaying Gratificaiton
==========================
Not too long ago a thirty-year-old financial analyst was complaining to me over a period of months about her tendency to procrastinate in her job. We had workded though her fellings about her employers and how they related to fellings about authority in general, and to her parents specifically. We had examined her attitudes toward work and success and how these related to her marriage, her sexual identity, her desire to compete with her husband, and her fears of such competition. Yet despite all this standard and painstaking psychoanalytic work, she continued to procrastinate as much as ever. Finally, one day, we dared to look at the obvious. "Do you like cake?" I asked her. She replied that she did. "Which part of the cake do you like better," I went on, "the cake or the frosting?" "Oh, the frosting!" she responded enthusiastically. "And how do you eat a piece of cake?" I required, feeling that I must be the most inane psychiatrist that ever lived. "I eat the frosting first,of course," she replied. From her cake-eating habits we went on to examine her work habits, and, as was to the more gratifying half of her work and the remaining six hours getting around to the objxtionable remainder. I suggested that if she were to force herself to accomplish the unpleasant part of her job during the first hour, she would then be free to enjoy the other six. It seemed to me , I said, that one hour of pain followed by six of pelasure was preferable to one hour of pleasure followed by six of pain. She agreed, and, beng basically a person of strong will, she no longer procrastinates.

不久前，一位30岁的金融分析师请求我的帮助，她想纠正在最近几个月里，总是拖延工作的恶习。我们探讨了她对老板的看法，老板对她的态度；她对权威的认识以及她的父母的情况。我们也谈到她对工作与成就的观念；这些观念对其婚姻观、性别观的影响；她同丈夫和同事竞争的愿望，以及竞争带给她的恐惧感。尽管一再努力，但这种常规心理分析和治疗，并未触及问题的症结。终于有一天，我们进入久被忽略的一个领域，才使治疗出现了转机。“你喜欢吃蛋糕吗？”我问。她回答说喜欢。“你更喜欢吃蛋糕，”我接着问，“还是蛋糕上涂抹的奶油？”她兴奋地说：“啊，当然是奶油啦！”“那么，你通常是怎么吃蛋糕的呢？”我接着又问。我也许是有史以来最愚蠢的心理医生了。她不假思索地说：“那还用说吗，我通常先吃完奶油，然后才吃蛋糕的。”就这样，我们从吃蛋糕的习惯出发，重新讨论她对待工作的态度。正如我预料的，在上班第一个钟头，她总是把容易和喜欢做的工作先完成，而在剩下六个钟头里，她就尽量规避棘手的差事。我建议她从现在开始，在上班第一个钟头，要先去解决那些麻烦的差事，在剩下的时间里，其他工作会变得相对轻松。考虑到她学的是财务管理，我就这样解释其中的道理：按一天工作七个钟头计算，一个钟头的痛苦，加上六个钟头的幸福，显然要比一个钟头的幸福，加上六个钟头的痛苦划算。她完全同意这样的计算方法，而且坚决照此执行，不久就彻底克服了拖延工作的坏毛病。

Delaying gratification is a process of scheduling the pain and pleasure of life in such a way a to enhance the pleasure by meeting and experiencing the pain first and getting it over with. It is the only decent way to live.

推迟满足感，意味着不贪图暂时的安逸，重新设置人生快乐与痛苦的次序：首先，面对问题并感受痛苦；然后，解决问题并享受更大的快乐，这是惟一可行的生活方式。

This tool or precess of scheduling is learned by most children quite early in life, sometimes as early as age five. For instance, occasionally a five-year-old when playing a game with a companion will suggest that the companion take first turn, so that the child might enjoy his or her turn later. At age six children may start eating their cake first and the frosting later. At age six children may start eating their cake first and the frosting last. Throughout grammar school this early capacity to the delay gratification is daily exercised, particularly through the performance of homework. By the age of twelve some children are already able to sit down on occasion without any parental prompting and complete their homework before they watch television. By the age of fifteen or sixteen such behavior is expected of the adolescent and is considered normal.

其实，我们早在小时候（通常从五岁开始），就可以学会自律的原则，避免只图眼前安逸带来的不利。例如在幼儿园里，有的游戏需要孩子们轮流参与，如果一个五岁的男孩多些耐心，暂且让同伴先玩游戏，而自己等到最后，就可以享受到更多的乐趣，他可以在无人催促的情况下，玩到尽兴方休。对于六岁的孩子而言，吃蛋糕时不把奶油一口气吃完，或者先吃蛋糕，后吃奶油，就可以享受到更甜美的滋味。小学的孩子正确对待家庭作业，是实践“推迟满足感”的最佳手段。孩子满12岁时，无须父母催促，首先做完功课，再去看电视。到了十五六岁以后，他们的实践更可以得心应手。到了青春期，他们处理类似问题，应该形成一种习惯或常态。

It becomes clear to their educators at this age, however, that a substantial number of adolescents fall fat short of this norm. While many have a well-developed this capacity at all; indeed, some seem even to lack the capacity entirely. These are the problem srudents. Despite average or better intelligence, their grades are poor simply because they do not work. They skip classes or skip school entirely on the whim of the moment. They are implusive, and their impulsiveness spills over into their social life as well. They get into frequent fights, they become involved with drugs, they begin to get in trouble with the police. Play now, pay later, is their motto. So the psychologists and psychotherapists are called in. But most of the time it seems too late. These adolescents are resentful of any attempt to intervene in their life style of impulsiveness, and even when this resentment can be overcome by warmth and friendliness and a nonjudgment attitude on the part of the therapist, their impulsiveness is often so severe that it precludes their participation in the process of psychotherapy in any meaningful way. They miss their appointments. They avoid all important and painful issues. So usually the attempt at intervention fails. and these children drop out of school, only to continue a pattern of failure that frequently lands them in disastrous marriages, in accidents, in psychiatric hospitals or in jail.

根据教育工作者的经验，不少青春期的少年，却缺少这种健康的常态。许多孩子懂得推迟满足感的好处，但还有的孩子显然缺乏能力和经验。有的孩子长到十五六岁，仍旧缺乏“先吃苦，后享受”的意识，而是恰好将次序颠倒过来，他们很容易成为“问题学生”。他们的智商与别人相比毫不逊色，但不肯用功学习，导致成绩远远落在别人后面。他们说话和做事，全凭一时冲动。只要心血来潮，他们动辄旷课或逃学。他们不愿思考，缺乏耐心，这很容易危及他们的社会生活：喜欢打架，与毒品为伴，故意与警方为难并发生冲突，此类情形司空见惯。“先享受，后付费”，成为他们的座右铭。他们最需要心理治疗，却往往为时已晚。意气用事的青少年，通常不喜欢被人干涉，即便心理治疗师能以客观、公正、亲切的姿态，慢慢化解他们的敌意，他们也难以积极配合整个治疗过程。他们的主观冲动过于强烈，经常逃避定期的治疗。心理医生的一切努力，常常以失败告终，最终这些孩子离开学校，浪迹社会。他们的成年生活也极为糟糕———婚姻不幸，精神恍惚、神不守舍，容易遭受意外事故，而精神病院或者监狱可能成为他们最终的归宿。

Why is this? Why do a majority develop a capacity to delay fratification while a substantial minority fail, often irretrievably, to develop this capacity. The answer is not absolutely, scientifically know. The role of genetic factors is unclear. The variables cannot be sufficiently controlled for scientific proof. But most of the signs rather clearly point to the quality of parenting as the determinant. 

为什么会出现这样的情形？为什么大部分人拥有足够的自制力，能避免贪图一时安逸的恶果，却有相当数量的人不懂得推迟满足感，最终成为失败者？其中的原因，目前医学界尚无定论，仅有的答案也缺乏足够的依据，基因的作用并不明显，其他因素也有待科学论证，但大部分迹象表明，在这方面，家庭教育起着相当大的作用。

The sins of the father
=============================
It is not that the homes of these unself-disciplined children are lacking in parental discipline of a sort. More often than not these children are punished frequently and severly throughout their childhood -- slapped, punched, kicked, beaten and whipped by their paents for even minor infractions. But this discipline is meaningless. Because it is undiciplined discipline.

缺少自律的孩子，未必是因为父母管教不严。不少孩子甚至经常遭受严厉的体罚，即便小有过错，父母也会劈头盖脸地打过去：掌掴、脚踢、鞭打、拳击，可谓花样翻新。这种教育不仅收效甚微，甚至反而使局面恶化。

One reason that it is meaningless, is that the parents themselves are unself-disciplined, and therefore serve as undisciplined role models for their children. They are the "Do as I say, Not as I do" parents. They may frequently get drunk in front of their children. THey may fignhtt with each other in front of the children without restraint, dignity or rationality. They may be slovenly. They make promises they don't keep. Their own libes are frequently and obviously in disorder and disarray, and their attempts to order the lives of their children seem therfore to make little sense to these children. If father beats up mother regularly, what sense does it make to a boy when his mother beats him up because he beat up his sister? Does it make sense when he's told that he must learn to control his tempet? Since we do not have the benefit of comparison when we are young, our parents are godlike figures to our children eyes. When parents do things a certain way, it seems to the young child the way to do them, the way they should be done. If a child sees his parents day in and day out behaving with self-discipline, restraint, dignity and a capacity to order their own lives, then the child will come to feel in the deepest fibers of his being that this is the way to live. If a child sees his parents day in and day our libing without self-restraint or self-discipline, then he will come in the deeppest fibersof being to believe that that is the way to live. 

父母本身难以自律，就不可能成为孩子的榜样。父母常常告诫孩子：“照我的话去做，不过别去学我。”他们酗酒无度，或在孩子面前恶语相向，甚至大打出手。他们缺乏起码的自制力，缺少长辈的尊严和理性；他们形容邋遢、一塌糊涂，甚至偷懒耍滑、背信弃义。他们的生活毫无章法，却强迫孩子有条不紊地生活。可想而知，假如父亲动辄殴打孩子的母亲，那么母亲因儿子欺负妹妹而对其施以体罚，又有多少意义呢？如何又能指望儿子听她的话，控制好情绪呢？在年幼的孩子心中，父母就像上帝那样位高权重。孩子缺乏其他模仿的对象，自然把父母处理问题的办法全盘接受下来，并视为金科玉律。父母懂得自律、自制和自尊，生活井然有序，孩子就会心领神会，并奉之为最高准则。父母的生活混乱不堪、任意妄为，孩子们同样照单全收，并视为不二法门。

Yet even more important than role modeling is love. For even in chatic and disordered homes genuine love is occasionally present, and form such homes may come may come self-disciplined children. And not infrequently parents who are professional people -- doctors, lawyers, club women and philanthropists -- who leads lives of strict orderlines and decorum but yet lack love, send children into the world who are as undisciplined and destructive and disorganized as any child from an impoverished and chaotic home.

父母的爱心至关重要，即便家庭生活混乱，倘若有爱存在，照样可以培养出懂得自律的孩子。父母身为医生、律师、企业经理、慈善家，即便在职业上得心应手，生活方式也相当严谨，倘若缺少爱和温情，他们培养的子女，就和成长在贫寒、混乱家庭的孩子一样，照样不懂得自律，照样随心所欲、无法无天。

Ultimatly love is everything. This mystery of love will be examined in later portions of this week. Yet, for the sake of coherency, it may be helpfui to make a brief but limited mention of it and its relationship to discipline at this point.

爱，关乎心灵的健康成长。在本书后面部分，我将就此深入探讨。爱，是身心健康必不可少的元素，所以有必要了解爱的实质，以及爱同自律的关系。

When we love something it is of value to us, and when something is of value to us we spend time with it, time enjoying it and time taking care of it. Observe a teenager. In love with his car and note the time he will spend admiring it, polishing it, repairing it, tuning it . Or and older person whirh a beloved rose garden, and the time spent pruning and mulching and fertilizing and studying it. So it is when we love children; we spend time admiring them and caring for them. We give them our time.

我们爱某样东西，就会乐于为它付出时间。譬如，某个青年终于拥有心仪已久的汽车，你就会发现，他把多少时间用在汽车上面：擦车、洗车、修车、给汽车美容、不停地欣赏它、整理汽车内室……你也可以观察，一个上了年纪的老人，如何照料他的花园：浇水、施肥、修剪、除虫、嫁接、移植……对子女的爱也同样如此，我们可以花更多的时间去照顾他们、陪伴他们。


Good discipline requires time. When we have no time to give our children, or no time that we are willing to give, we don't even observe them closely enough to become aware of when their need for our disciplinary assistance id expressed subtly. If their need for discipline is so gross as to impinge upon our consciousness, we may still ignore the need on the grounds that it's easier to let them have their own way -- "I just don't have the energy to deal with them today." Or, finally, if we are impelled into action by their misdeeds and our irritation, we will impose discipline, often brutally, out of anger rather than deliberation, without examining the problem or even taking the time to consider which form of discipline is the most appropriate to that particular problem.


让孩子学会自律，也需要时间。不把精力用在孩子身上，与孩子相处的时间少得可怜，就无法深入了解其需要，就不知道他们在自律方面，还需要哪些条件。遗憾的是，即便孩子明显需要纪律训练的时候，我们可能照样无知无觉，甚至不管不顾。“我没精力管你们，你们想怎么样，就怎么样吧！”最后，到了危机时刻，孩子的错误导致我们恼怒，我们就会把满腔怨气发泄出来。我们根本不愿去调查问题的本质，也不考虑哪种教育模式最适合。父母习惯用严厉的体罚教训孩子，本质上不是教育，而是发泄怨气和不满。

The parents who devote time to their children even when it is not demanded by glaring misdeeds will perceive in them subtle needs for discipline, to which they will respond with gentle urging or reprimand or stucture or parise, administered with thoughtfulness and care. They will observe how their children eat cake, how they study, when they tell subtle falsehoods, when they run away from problems rather than face them. They will take the time to make these monor corrections and adjustments, listening to their children, responding to them, tightening a little here, liisening a little there, giving them little lectures, little hugs and kisses, little admonishments, little pats on the back.

聪明的父母决不会这样做。他们愿意花时间了解孩子，对症下药地教育孩子。哪怕孩子犯了大错，他们也恰当运用敦促、鼓励、表扬，或必要的警告和责备。他们灵活调整孩子的发展方向，认真观察孩子的言行举止：吃蛋糕、做功课、撒谎、欺骗、逃避任务……他们也会倾听孩子的心里话，在对孩子的管教上，他们掌握分寸，张弛有度。他们给孩子讲有意义的故事，适时亲吻、拥抱、爱抚他们，及时纠正孩子的问题。

So it is that the quality of discipline afforded by loving parents is superior to the discipline of unloving parents. But this is just the beginning. In taking the time to observe and to think about their chidren's needs, loving parents will frequently agonize over the decisions to be made, and will, in a very real sense, suffer along with their children. The children are not blind to this. They perceive it when their parents are willing to suffer with them , and although they may not respond with immediate gratitude, they will learn also to suffer. "If my parents are willing to suffer with me," they will tell themselves, "then suffering must not be so bad, and I shoulf be willing to suffer with myself." THis is the beginning of self-discipline.

毋庸置疑，父母的爱，决定了家庭教育质量的优劣。充满爱的教育带来幸运；缺乏爱的教育只能导致不幸。富有爱心的父母，善于审视孩子的需要，做出理性、客观的判断。他们也可能在面临痛苦抉择时，与孩子一道经受痛苦和折磨。孩子也当然会逐渐意识到，父母甘心陪着忍受苦楚的一片苦心。他们未必立刻流露感激之情，却可以领悟到痛苦的内涵和真谛，他们提醒自己：“既然爸爸妈妈愿意陪着我忍受痛苦，痛苦就不见得那么可怕，而且未必是太坏的事。我也应该承担责任，面对属于自己的痛苦。”———这就是自律的起点。

The time and the quality of the time that their parents devote to them indicate to children the degree to which they are valued by their parents. Some basically unloving parents, in an attempt to cover up their lack of caring, make frequent professions of love to therir children, repetitively and mechanically telling them how much they are valued, but not devoting significant time of high quality to them. THeri children are never totally deceived by such hollow words. Consciously they may cling to them, wating to believe that they are loved, but unconsciously they know that their parents's word do not match up with their deeds.

父母付出的努力越大，孩子感受到的重视程度，就越是强烈。有的父母为掩饰在家庭教育上的失败，就会不停地告诉孩子，说自己是多么爱他们，多么重视他们，云云，但真相无法逃过孩子的眼睛。孩子不会被谎言和欺骗长期蒙蔽，他们渴望得到父母的爱，但父母一再出尔反尔，只会让他们渐失信心。即便他们表面不会牢骚不断，或大发雷霆，可父母的教导和许诺，近乎一钱不值。更为糟糕的是，他们会情不自禁地模仿父母，拷贝父母的处世方式，将它视为人生的标准和榜样。

On the other hand, children who are truly loved, although in moments of pique they may consciously feel or proclaim that they are being neglected, unconsciously know themselves to be valued. This knowledge id worth more than any gold. For when children know that they are valued, when they truly feel valued in the deepest parts of themselves, then they feel valuable.

那些沐浴着父母的爱的孩子，心灵却可以健全发展。他们也可能因父母一时的忽视表示不满，然而他们对父母的爱感激不尽。父母的珍视让他们懂得珍惜自己，懂得选择进步而不是落后，懂得追求幸福而不是自暴自弃。他们将自尊自爱作为人生起点，这有着比黄金还要宝贵的价值。
