Problems and Pain
========================
Life is difficult.
This is a great truth, one of the greatest truth.
The first of "Four Noble Truths" which Buddha taught was "Life is suffering".

人生苦难重重。
这是个伟大的真理，是世界上最伟大的真理之一。

It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult--once we truly understand and accept it--then life is no longer difficult. Beacuse once it is accepted, the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.

它的伟大，在于我们一旦想通了它，就能实现人生的超越。只要我们知道人生是艰难的———只要我们真正理解并接受这一点，那么我们就再也不会对人生的苦难耿耿于怀了。因为一旦它被接受，生活困难这个事实就不再重要了

Most do not see this truth that life is difficult. Instead they moan more or less incessantly, noisily or subtly, about the enormity of their problems, their burdens, and their difficulties as if life were generally easy, as if life should be easy. They voice their belief, noisily or subtly, that their difficulties represent a unique kind of affliction that should not be and that has some how been especially visited upon them, or else upon their families, their tribe, their class, their nation, their race or even their species, and not upon others. I know about theis moaning because I have done my share.

然而，大部分人却不愿正视它。他们不是怨天尤人，就是抱怨自己生而不幸，他们总是哀叹无数麻烦、压力、困难与其为伴，他们认为自己是世界上最不幸的人，在他们看来，似乎人生本该既舒适又顺利。他们表达他们的坚信，吵闹的或巧妙地，他们的困难代表一种独特的苦难本不该出现，但是命运偏偏让他们自己、他们的家人、他们的部落、他们的社会阶级、他们的国家和民族乃至他们的人种吃苦受罪———我熟悉类似的抱怨和诅咒，因为我也曾有过同样的感受。

Life is a series of problems. Do we want to moan about them or solve them？ Do we want to teach out children to solve them?
人生是一连串的难题，面对它，你是哭哭啼啼，还是勇敢奋起？你是束手无策地哀叹，还是积极地想方设法解决问题，并慷慨地将方法传给后人呢？

Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With only some discipline we can solve only some problems. With total dicipline we can solve all problems.
解决人生问题的首要方案，乃是自律，缺少了这一环，你不可能解决任何麻烦和困难。局部的自律只能解决局部的问题，完整的自律才能解决所有的问题。

What makes life difficult is that the process of confronting and solving problems is a painful one. Problems, depending upon their nature, evoke in us frustration or grief or sadness or loneliness or guilt or regret or anger or fear or anxiety or anguish or despair. Their are uncomfortable feelings, often very uncomfortable, often as painful as any kind of physical pain, sometimes equaling the very worst kind of physical pain. Indeed, it is because of the pain that events or conflicts engender in us all that we call them problems. And since life poses an endless series of problems, life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy.

生活之所以困难，是因为面对和解决问题的过程是痛苦的。问题的性质不同，会唤起我们沮丧、悲伤、悲伤、孤独、内疚、后悔、愤怒、恐惧、焦虑、痛苦或绝望的感觉。心灵之痛，通常和肉体之痛一样剧烈，甚至更加难以承受。事实上，正是因为事件或冲突在我们身上产生的痛苦，我们才称之为问题。正是因为各种问题接踵而来，我们才觉得人生苦难重重，悲喜参半。

Yet it is in this whole process of meeting and solving problems that life has its meaning. Problems are the cutting edge that distinguishes between success and failure. Problems call forth our courage and our wisdom; indeed, they create our courage and our wisdom. It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually. When we desire to encourage the growth of the human spirit, we challenge and encourage the human capacity to solbe problems, just as in school we deliberatly set problems for our children to solve. It is through the pain of confronting and resolving problems that we learn. As Benjamin Franklin said, "Those things that hurts, instruct." It is for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems and actully to welcome the pain of problems.

人生在一个面对问题并解决问题的过程中有了意义。问题能启发我们的智慧，激发我们的勇气；问题是我们成功与失败的分水岭。困难激发我们的勇气和智慧;事实上，它们创造了我们的勇气和智慧。正是因为这些问题，我们的精神和精神才得以成长。当我们想要鼓励人类精神的成长时，我们挑战并鼓励人类解决问题的能力，就像在学校里我们故意为我们的孩子设置问题来解决一样。正是通过直面和解决问题的痛苦，我们才得以学习。正如本杰明·富兰克林(BenjaminFranklin)所说:“惟有痛苦才会带来教益。”面对问题，聪明者不因害怕痛苦而选择逃避，而是迎上前去，直至将其战胜为止。

Most of us are not so wise. Fearing the pain involved, almost all of us, to a greater or lesser degree, attempt to avoid problems. We procrastinate, hoping that they will go away. We ignore them, forget them, so that by deadening ourselves to the pain we can forget the problems that cause the pain. We attempt to skirt around problems rather than meet them head on. We attempt to get out of them rather than suffer through them.

我们大多数人都不那么聪明。几乎我们所有人，或多或少，都因害怕所涉及的痛苦而试图避免问题。我们拖延，希望它们会消失。我们忽略他们，忘记他们，这样通过麻木我们自己的痛苦，我们可以忘记引起痛苦的问题。我们试图回避问题，而不是直接面对问题。我们试图摆脱它们，而不是忍受它们。

This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness. Since most of us have this tendency to a greater or lesser degree, most of us are mentally ill to a greater or lesser degree, lacking complete mental health. Some of us will go to quite extraodinary lengths to avoid out problems and the suffering they cause, proceeding far afield from all that is clearly good and sensible in order to try to find an easy way out, building the most elaborate fantasies in which to live, sometimes to the total exclusion of reality. In the succinctly elegeant words of Carl Jung, "Neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering."

规避问题和逃避痛苦的趋向，是人类心理疾病的根源。人人都有逃避问题的倾向，因此大多数人的心理健康都存在缺陷，真正的健康者寥寥无几。有的逃避问题者，宁可躲藏在头脑营造的虚幻世界里，甚至完全与现实脱节，这无异于作茧自缚。心理学大师荣格更是明确地指出：“神经症，是人生痛苦常见的替代品。”

But the substitute itself ultimately becomes more painful than the legitimate suffering it was designed to avoid. The neurosis itself becomes the biggest problem. True to form, many will then attempt to avoid this pain and this problem in turn, building layer upon layer of neuroses and begin -- usually with the helo og psychotherapy -- to learn how to experience legitimate suffering. In any case, when we avoid the legitimate suffering that results from dealing with problems, we also avoid the growth that problems demand from us. It is for the reason that in chronic mental illness we stop growing, we become stuck. And without healing, the human spirit begins to shrivel.

替代品带来的痛苦，甚至比逃避的痛苦更为强烈，神经症由此成了更棘手的问题。不少人为逃避新的问题和痛苦，不断以神经官能症为替代品，导致患上各种心理疾病。所幸也有人能坦然面对神经官能症，及时寻求心理医生帮助，以正确的心态面对人生正常的痛苦。事实上，如果不顾一切地逃避问题和痛苦，就会由此失去以解决问题推动心灵成长的契机，导致心理疾病越来越严重，而长期的、慢性的心理疾病，就会使人的心灵停止生长。不及时治疗，心灵就会萎缩和退化，心智就永远难以成熟。

Therefore let us inculcate in ourselves and in our children the means of achieving mental and spiritual health. By this I mean let us teach ourselves and our children the necessity for suffering and the value thereof, the need to face problems directly and to experience the pain involved. I have stated that discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life's problems. It will become clear that these tools are techniques of suffering, means by which we experience the pain of problems in such a way as to work them through and solve them successfully, learning and growing in the process. When we teach ourselves and our children discipline, we are teaching them and ourselves how to suffer and also how to grow.

因此，让我们向我们自己和我们的孩子灌输达到精神和精神健康的方法,人生的问题和痛苦具有非凡的价值。勇于承担责任，敢于面对困难，才能够使心灵变得健康。自律，是解决人生问题的首要工具，也是消除人生痛苦的重要手段。我的意思是，让我们教导自己和我们的孩子受苦的必要性及其价值，直接面对问题和经历相关痛苦的必要性。我已经说过，自律是我们解决生活问题的基本工具。很明显，这些工具是痛苦的技巧，是我们体验问题的痛苦的方式，从而解决问题并成功地解决问题，在这个过程中学习和成长。我们教育自己和孩子自律，也是在教育我们双方如何忍受痛苦，获得成长。

What are these tools, these techniques of suffering, these means of experiencing the pain of problems constructively that I call discipline? There are four: delaying of gratificaiton, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing. As will be evident, there are not complex tools whose application demands entensive training, To the contrary, they are simpel tools. and almost all children are adept in their use by the age of ten. Yet presidents and kings will often forget to use them, to their own downfall. The problem lies not in the complexity of these tools but in the will to use them. For they are tools with which pain is confronted rather than avoided, and if one seeks to avoid legitimate suffering, then one will avoid the use of these tools. Therefore, after analyzing each of these tools, we shall in the next section examine the will to use them, which is love.

这些工具，这些折磨的技巧，这些建设性地体验问题痛苦的方法我称之为自律的是什么?所谓自律，是以积极而主动的态度，去解决人生痛苦的重要原则，主要包括四个方面：推迟满足感、承担责任、尊重事实、保持平衡。它们并不复杂，不过要想正确地运用它们，你需要细心体会，广泛实践。它们其实相当简单，即便是十岁的小孩，也能够最终掌握。不过有时候，即使贵为一国之君，也会因忽略和漠视它们而遭到报复，自取灭亡。实践这些原则，关键在于你的态度，你要敢于面对痛苦而非逃避。对于时刻想着逃避痛苦的人，这些原则不会起到任何作用，他们也绝不会从自律中获益。接下来，我要对这几种原则深入阐述，然后再探讨它们背后的原动力———爱。
