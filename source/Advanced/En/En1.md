Talk about a person you admire a lot and explain why you admire him or her. Use details and examples in your response.
## topic
Allen Iverson, the NBA superstar, is definitely one of the people for whom I have a huge admiration.
## support sentence
I admire him a lot because he is such a hard-working guy that you would feel like there’s nothing he cannot do. 
## example
Once I watched an interview of his coach in high school on NBC. He said that Allen was just super diligent. 
He was always the first person that arrived for the training, and always the last one to leave. 
He usually stayed for another 2 hours after all his teammates left for dinner. 
So it’s definitely his hard work that made him one of the most phenomenal players in the league.

```markdown
If you were going to take a trip alone, what would you take with you? Please include details in your response.
## topic
If I’m traveling myself, I guess I’ll take a lot of items with me, among which my iPad is a must. You know, it’s always pretty boring when you travel alone, especially when you’re on a plane or train. 
With iPad, I can do a lot of things to kill that kind of boring time. 
For example, I can chat with my friends through MSN or Facetime, play video games, watch movies, etc. I still have a very clear memory of my trip to Australia; it’s the iPad that got me through the tedious 10-hour flight. I can’t even imagine how bored I would be if I had to sit in the cabin doing nothing for such a long period of time.

```markdown
Some people like to have dinner in a restaurant. Others like to cook dinner for themselves. Which do you think is better, and why? Please use details and examples to explain your answer.
## topic
I have a pretty hectic life, so I guess having dinner in a restaurant is definitely a better choice for me. 
## support 
 You know, the problem is that I really don ’ t have that much time to cook for myself. 
## example
I can show you why it’s a mission impossible. I got off work every day probably some time between 7 and 8 . If I want to have dinner at home, I’m going to have to spend 1 hour buying food materials in the grocery store, and probably another 1  hour cooking — I’m a terrible cook, by the way. So when I ’ m done cooking, it ’ s around  10. I seriously doubt that I still want to eat, not just go to bed or something.
```

```markdown
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?“It is always better to have more than one leader in a group.” Use details and examples to explain your answer.
Admittedly, more people can contribute more ideas, but I don’t think having multiple leaders in a group always helps us work better. 
In many cases, this is quite a deficiency because it seriously slows down the decision making process. 
Let me give you an example. When I was in high school, I worked in the student union, and we have like 5 or 6 people who all believed they were in charge. Once we were trying to find a venue for a prom. People all seemed to have their own preferences and just didn’t want to make any concession. It took us 3 hours, yeah, 3 hours to reach a consensus. If there had been only one boss, we could have gotten a final plan much more quickly.
