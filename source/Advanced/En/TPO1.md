#### sen

* By  far  the  most  abundant  type  of  groundwater  is  meteoric  water;  this  is  the 
    groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle
* They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed.
* The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known as glacial outwash, that 
    was deposited as the flow slowed down.   
* In lowland country  almost  any spot on  the ground  may overlie  what was  once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water’s upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.  低地区域上的任何位置可能就是曾经的河床，后续被土壤覆盖而变成现在的样子。如果那些河床和沙洲现在位于地下水位之下，一定会有大量的地下水浸在它们的沙砾和沙石之间。 
* The  result  is  that  sandstone,  for  example,  can  be  as  porous  as  the  loose  sand  from 
    which it was formed. 

#### pros

* 观点错误Groundwater ==often== remains underground for a long time before it emerges again
* 过于细节Like sandstone, basalt is a crystalline rock that is very porous. 
* 偏离主题Beds  of  unconsolidated  sediments  are  typically  located  at  inland  sites  that  were  once underwater.

Student
Hi, um…, I really hope you can help me.

Librarian
That’s why I’m here. **What can I do for you?**

Student
I’m supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course, but um… having a hard time finding articles. I don’t even know where to start looking.

Librarian
You said this is for your psychology course, right? So your focus is on …

Student
Dream Interpretation.

Librarian
Well, you have a focus, so that’s already a good start. Hmmm… well, there’re a few things… oh wait… ==have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve?==

Student
Aha, that’s one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals.

Librarian
==Let’s get you going on looking for those then==. ==We have printed versions of twenty psychology journals in the Reference Section.== These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it… there’s a journal named SleepandDream.

Student
Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I’ve got to look at other sources.

Librarian
Ok, actually, **most of our materials are available electronically now**. You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library’s computers, and if you want to search by title with the word ‘dream’ for example, just type it in and all the articles with ‘dream’ in the title will come up on the screen.

Student
Cool, that’s great! Too bad I cannot do this from home.

Librarian
==But you can==. All of the library’s databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network.

Student
Really?! I can’t believe I didn’t know that.==It still sounds like it’s going to take a while though, you know, going through all of that information, all of those sources.==

Librarian
Maybe, but you already narrow your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn’t be too bad. And you probably notice that **there’s an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied.** When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time.

Student
Right, abstracts! They’ll definitely make the project more durable.**I guess I should try out the electronic search while I’m still here then, you know, just in case.**

Librarian
Sure, er… that computer’s free over there, and **I’ll be here till five this afternoon.**

Student
Thanks, I feel a lot better about this ==assignment== now.

### L Lec 1

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a ==contemporary art== class.

Professor
Ok, I’m going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. ==Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it?== Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up. It’s already started in fact, but it’ll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment.
The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. **Frantzen’s work may be unfamiliar to you since she’s a ==relatively== (相对)young artist.** But she’s got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we’ve looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen’s style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. ==So you’ve probably studied both of these movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism==, in some of your art history courses. So who can just sum these up?

Student
Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um…the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles. It didn’t ==depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um… Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough.==

Professor
Good. What else? What were the subjects?

Student
Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes,lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes.

Professor
Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting.It’s a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. **The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen’s style**. It’s an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. ==It’s kind of bleak, which you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines.==The colors aren’t quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, in a natural… pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that’s the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me. One interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn. And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, **was to observe people and the ways that they moved**. She really found that this helped her work---that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too.
So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in
Frantzen’s work?

Student
Um… ==real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday
subject matter, too.==

Professor
Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by
pumpkins（南瓜）. **You will notice that the woman’s face is so realistic looking that it’s almost like aphotograph.** The woman’s nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism. But then, the background of the painting, this woman with ==the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes==, **and, it’s all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close**. And there are vibrant colors. There’s lots of orange,==with little hints of an electric blue peeking out.==

**I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to ==appreciate== them, you have to know their life story. But here’s a little bit about Rose Frantzen’s life anyway.** She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at ==illustration==, that she should go into advertising instead. So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist. But of course, it’s not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people’s portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more series of art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country. **So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. **But what’s important is that you keep at it that you don’t give up. That’s what is really important to remember.

### L Lec 2

Professor
Ok, let’s get started. Great. ==Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is== - **dating techniques**. I’m going to talk about a particular dating technique. Why? Good dating is a key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how a land formation was formed, the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is. It’s fundamental.

Um… ==Take the Grand Canyon for instance==. Now, we geologists thought we had a pretty good  idea of how the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed. ==We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified 固化somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago.== Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. <u>Essentially</u> it was part of a vast desert. ==And **until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time**==. （直到最近，我们大多数人还认为沙子来自古老的山脉，随着时间的流逝，山峰变得很平坦）==That’s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite sometime.==这是相当一段时间以来地质学家的传统看法，But now we’ve learned something different, and quite surprising, using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating.

I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. But there have been some recent ==refinements.==细化 I will ==get into this in a minute.== Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. That’s really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon. Sounds pretty unbelievable, right?

Of course, the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west? The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there. Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. Um… and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. Why? Well, as everyone in this class should know,  **==we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the sandstone表示砂岩中的实际颗粒, to determine where it came from.==** You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing. But that’s only useful up to a point, and that’s not what these two geologists did. Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon锆石 is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes. Zircon starts off as molten magma（熔岩）, the hot larva from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes（结晶）. And when Zircon crystallizes,==the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead==.里面的铀开始变成铅 So **if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircongrain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges. Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains.** If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used tobe part of that particular mountain range. Is everybody with me on that? Good.So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite（花岗岩） in the Appalachian Mountains was formed. So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we’ve been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong.

Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. But, um… until recently, in order to do it, you really had to study many individual grains. And it took a long time before yougot results. It just wasn’t very efficient. And it wasn’t very accurate. **But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your results faster.** So I’ll predict that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method. **There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating. ==Here is one that comes to mind.== **You know the theory that earth’s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. If they show evidence of once having been joined, that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet’s geology.
