Abstract
**************

* Despite much insightful work on polycentric urban development in China, there is a lack of systematic comparison at the `intra-city`_ level. 
* Therefore, this paper explores polycentric urban development in 318 cities of China using detailed gridded population data :class:`Pop`. 
* Our analysis examines the spatial structure of urbanized area within individual cities and identifies population centers within cities that are at the prefectural level and above. Our empirical results suggest that over 90% of Chinese cities have four or fewer ‘centers’, and **approximately 40% only have one ‘dominating’ center**. 
* Regression models :class:`Regression` reveal that higher degrees of polycentricity are associated with cities in fragmented landscapes. 
* Conditioning on topographic characteristics and total land area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is associated positively with high polycentricity in Eastern China.
* Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the development of multiple (sub)centers in a number of cities (e.g., Shanghai and Tianjin) is relatively consistent with their master plans.

Intro
***************
The emergence of polycentric urban development has been highlighted in recent literature (Anas, Arnott, & Small, 1998; Audirac, 2005; Musterd & Kloosterman, 2001; Vasanen, 2012). **Polycentric cities are formed when previously close-by but independent urban settlements form a larger and more integrated city-system**. Polycentricity is oftentimes deemed a desirable urban form, generating greater agglomeration externalities as well as facilitating the achievement of social, economic, and environmen- tal goals (Parr, 2004). More importantly, polycentricity has been observed and analyzed at various geographical scales, including the `intra-city`_ scale, the `inter-city`_ scale, and the `trans-regional`_ scale.

This paper focuses on polycentric urban development at the `intra-city`_ level in China, based on the identification of intra-city population centers. As the world’s most populous country and largest developing economy, China’s urban transformation has significant global socioeconomic and environmental impacts (Bai, Shi, & Liu, 2014). A recent World Bank report suggests that China is home to approximately 70% cities with more than 100 thousands people in East Asia and the Pacific region (World Bank, 2015). 

Among all strategies and measures to tackle the challenges of China’s urban transformation, we witness an increase in normative plans and policies that target at polycentric urban development (Liu, Derudder, & Wu, 2015). For example, (polycentric) urban regions are identified as the cornerstone in the recently released `national plan for ‘new form of urbanization’`_ and also referred to in `China’s Central Urban Work Conference`_ in December 2015. In addition, ‘polycentric urban patterns’ are deliberately sought after in many cities’ strategic plans (Qin & Han, 2013; Yue, Fan, Wei, & Qi, 2014). For example, in a study conducted by the `National Reform and Development Commission of China`_, 133 out of the 144 `prefectural level cities`_ included in the survey **are planning to develop or developing new districts/towns outside their old urban cores** (Sun & Wei, 2015). More recently, the drive for polycentricity is evidenced by the plan in which Beijing’s `municipal government`_, along with tens of thousands of civil servants and other supporting functions, will be moved out of the crowded old city to a satellite town. **This trend resonates with an international quest for polycentric urban development**. For example, `European spatial and social development policies`_ highlight the benefits of polycentric urban development (Burger & Meijers, 2012; Hall & Pain, 2006), and discussions about ‘megaregion’ as a planning and governance tool (re)surface in the US (Nelson & Lang, 2011).

Despite many insightful studies on polycentric urban development in China, there lacks a systematic comparison at the intra-city level. On the one hand, most analyses have focused on inter-city or regional polycentricity, i.e., polycentric urban regions or megaregions (Yang, 2005; Liu, Derudder, et al., 2015; Yang, Song, & Lin, 2015; Zhang & Wu, 2006). On the other hand, case studies of urban polycentricity at the intra-city scale are restricted to a few larger cities along the Eastern coast, such as Beijing (Qin & Han, 2013; Zhao, Lu, & de Roo, 2011), Shanghai (Lehmann, 2013; Yue et al., 2014), Guangzhou (Wu, 1998), and Hangzhou (Yue, Liu, & Fan, 2010). As ideas about urban polycentricity are increasingly put into normative plans, systematic analyses of intra-city polycentricity would help generate a better understanding of polycentric urban development, as well as evaluating relevant development policies and plans. (现有研究缺陷)

Aiming to help fill this gap, this paper presents an exploratory analysis of intra-city polycentricity across China using detailed gridded population data. More specifically, our paper examines the spatial structure of urban area within individual cities and is organized as follows. The next section introduces the definition of polycentricity, identification of sub-centers as well as measurement of morphological polycentricity for individual cities. We then discuss our data and the calculation of different polycentric measures. Polycentric development patterns in China are subsequently reviewed, and the association with socioeconomic, physical, and political factors is presented. The paper concludes with a summary of major findings, methodological limitations and avenues for further research.

Data and Methods
********************
data and study area
==========================
Our analysis starts with 364 Mainland Chinese cities at the prefectural level and above. **To ease comprehension for international readers, the nature of a prefecture-level city needs some clarification** (see Li, 2014 for a comprehensive review of the Chinese planning and administrative system): Within the Chinese administrative division system, a prefectural-level city (di ji shi) ranks below a provincial-level unit but above county-level units. A prefectural level city usually comprises of core urban districts and their surrounding region which in turn contains districts, county-level cities, counties, towns, and/or other sub-divisions. In other words, a Chinese prefectural city resembles an intra-city urban system, consisting of a central urban area and outlying urbanized areas such as the seats of counties. In addition to prefecture-level cities, our analysis includes four `municipalities`_ under direct control of the central government (i.e., Beijing, Tianjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing), which have the same administrative ranks as provinces.

The measurement of polycentricity is based on the LandScanTM High Resolution Global Population Dataset :data:`LandScanTM` (Dobson, Bright, Coleman, Durfee, & Worley, 2000), which estimates global population distributions in approximately 1 km by 1 km grids. Errors in population estimation ``notwithstanding``, the LandScan dataset offers two advantages in understanding urban spatial structures: First, LandScan characterizes population distributions at a fine spatial resolution, while official census data are usually aggregated at the city level and do not reflect intra-city population distribution. Second, existing attempts at downscaling aggregated census data (e.g., Wu, Long, Mao, & Liu, 2015) are affected by political/administrative boundary changes, thus becoming less useful for longitudinal analyses. In addition, LandScan averages population distribution over a 24-h period, partially taking commuting and population migration into consideration. LandScan data are gathered for the year of 2012.

As LandScan data only characterize the spatial distribution of population, individual urban centers (including both core urban districts and subcenters) identified by our approach correspond to population rather than employment centers. While the analysis of employment centers is key to understanding the urban spatial economy (Giuliano & Small, 1991), there is usually a mismatch between employment and population centers (as characterized by job-housing (im)balance). A close examination of population centers is still ``policy-relevant`` in the Chinese context (Shen & Wang, 2012; Wang & Meng, 1999). For example, the redistribution/control of population is highlighted in many master plans and per-capita standards are widely employed in determining the supply of public services and infrastructure (Li, 2014).

City-level Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population statistics for 2012 are collected from China City Statistical Yearbook :data:`Statistics` . Our analysis also includes the standard deviation of landform curvature for individual cities, which is derived from the digital elevation model (DEM) of China. :class:`DEM` The DEM data are acquired from the United States Geological Survey. Following the definition of Chinese macro-regions in Fan and Sun (2008), cities are grouped into three regions: the eastern, the western, and the central.

Defining and measuring polycentricity
========================================
We employ a straightforward and morphological definition of polycentricity (Halbert et al., 2006). The polycentricity of individual cities is measured based on the size and distribution of intra-city centers; a city is deemed more polycentric if it is characterized by a more balanced distribution of centers (Meijers & Burger, 2010; Musterd & Kloosterman, 2001; Parr, 2004). In other words, a polycentric city would be consist of a group of urban centers with a relatively even distribution of importance. Various urban characteristics have been employed to approximate the ‘importance’ of individual centers, such as population size, employment counts, and GDP (Batty, 2013; Meijers & Burger, 2010). In addition, we are aware of the functional, relational, and political dimensions of polycentricity (Halbert et al., 2006; Liu, Derudder et al., 2015). **Although these perspectives generate more nuanced understandings of polycentric cities, they usually have higher data requirements.** For example, functional and relational approaches to polycentricity require information about the flows of people, information and goods among individual centers. However, measuring intra-city flows is difficult, especially for a large number of cities (Liu, Derudder et al., 2015). Still, there is usually a positive association between morphological and other forms of polycentricity (Burger & Meijers, 2012; Vasanen, 2012). Therefore, our analysis adopts a morphological definition of polycentricity.

Polycentricity can also be measured in a number of different ways. A first rank-size based method characterizes polycentricity by either the slope of the regression line that characterizes the rank-size distribution of centers within a city (Batty, 2008; Meijers & Burger, 2010), and/or the degree to which the largest center deviates from the rank-size distribution (Meijers, 2008). A number of modifications and improvements have been proposed to rank-size based methods, such as estimating polycentricity based on the second, third and fourth largest (sub) centers within a given city (Meijers & Burger, 2010); and transforming the actual rank to reduce small sample bias (Gabaix & Ibragimov, 2011). However, it is difficult to normalize polycentricity measures produced by rank-size based methods, making the interpretation less straightforward (Green, 2007). 

A second type of polycentricity indices draws upon (in) equality measures, such as the Gini Coefficient (Combes & Overman, 2004). More recently, Pereira, Nadalin, Monasterio, and Albuquerque (2013) have reviewed the shortcomings of existing (in) equality measures and propose a new urban centrality index (UCI) to gauge the degree of centrality/polycentricity. Nevertheless, the calculation of UCI is computationally intensive for gridded data as the process involves computing pairwise distances among all grids.

Therefore, we adopt a third polycentricity indicator which is defined by examining the standard deviation of (the size of) (sub) centers (Green, 2007; Liu, Derudder, et al., 2015)

Identifying centers
======================
Our measurement of polycentricity is based on the identification of centers. In the study of urban form, **a working definition of centers is a cluster of analytic units (be they census tracts or grids) that have significantly higher density of population, employment and/or business than surrounding areas** (Leslie, 2010). As implied above, centers identified in our approach would include both core urban districts (such as CBDs) and subcenters (such as satellite towns and edge cities). There is a rich literature in identifying urban centers, using different criteria (e.g., population size, employment size, and land use mix) and based on different spatial units (e.g., census tract and regular grids; Cervero, 1989; Lee, 2007). Conventional meth- ods apply single cut-offs on different attributes, such as population and employment counts (Giuliano & Small, 1991). The key shortcoming of this single (absolute) minimum cut-off approach is that there are no one-size-fits-all criteria for all cities. As a corollary, diverse urban development patterns in China make it difficult to adopt this single cut-off approach.** More recent studies use relative criteria of varied types, including adapted criteria (Lee, 2007), spatial statistical (McMillen, 2001), Kernel density (Leslie, 2010), and spatial clustering (Vasanen, 2012) methods.**

Following Lee (2007), we adopt a relative minimum cut-off approach. For each city, we identify densely populated LandScan grids by set a minimum density cutoffs at the level of its 95- percentile population density (i.e., selecting the top 5% of most densely populated LandScan grids within a city). This threshold is set to 90-percentile for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin. The rationale for applying such a ``hybrid criteria`` is based on an analysis of density profiles. A city’s density profile is created based on the distribution of population density in individual grids within the corresponding city. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests :meth:`kolmogorov_smirnov_tests` are employed to assess whether two cities’ density profiles :meth:`profile` are significantly different from each other. Results suggest that the density profiles of the five cities mentioned above (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin) are less similar to those of other cities. In addition, a visual inspection suggests that the density profiles of these five cities follow a bimodal distribution :meth:`biomodel_distribution`, while other Chinese cities usually have one ‘peak’ in their density profiles. Consequently, having a lower minimum cutoff (90-percentile instead of 95-percentile) would help us to characterize the bimodal density profiles of these five cities. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis :meth:`sensitivity_analysis` is reported in section 2.6 to assess whether employing separate thresholds for the five cities would significantly affect our results. Once identified, significantly dense population grids that are adjacent to each other (i.e., rook contiguity) are combined to form clusters. We then define ‘centers’ as those clusters of grids that contain more than 100,000 inhabitants and include at least three grids. The population size of individual centers in a city is inserted into Equitation 1 to calculate polycentricity. 

A ``preliminary experiment`` suggests that individual centers identified by our cut-off based approach are mostly large and spatially separated urbanized areas within a prefectural level city, such as the core urban districts, county-level cities, county seas, and new towns/districts (See for example, Figs. 3 and 4 ). In other words, our polycentricity measure tends to characterize the spatial structure of urbanized areas (i.e., intra-city urban systems) within a prefecture-level city rather than individual clusters of population within the urban core.(我们的多中心测度倾向于表征在地级市内部的城市化区域的空间结构(即城市内空间结构)，而不是城市核心内的单个人口集群。) **Nevertheless, this focus on intra-city urban systems coincides with the geographical scale of many plans and policies that aim to foster polycentricity**(尽管如此，这种对城市内部系统的关注与许多旨在促进多中心的计划和政策的地理范围是一致的). For example, polycentric urban patterns are oftentimes pursued through establishing/developing new towns and districts outside the old city centers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai (e.g., Sun & Wei, 2015).

Regression analysis
==========================
We conduct an exploratory regression analysis to assess the association between Green’s polycentricity index (P) and physi- cal (Curvature) and socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita;GDP). This regression analysis would help us generate preliminary but important hypotheses regarding the formation of polycentric cities. As we have grouped Chinese cities into three regions, a categori- cal variable (Region) is introduced to capture regional differences. Total land area for each city (Area) is also included as a control variable. Our curvature measure reflects a second order deriva- tive of DEM, indicating the marginal change of landscape slope. Therefore, within a given city, the standard deviation of the cur- vature of landform represents the dispersion of the marginal slope change, depicting the overall topographical characteristics of that city. We take logarithm of total area and GDP per capita to scale all variables in a similar magnitude. We note that our regression analysis is largely exploratory and future analysis could incorpo- rate additional theoretically informed variables. We have employed a forward model selection strategy. Results for both intermediate and full models are reported in Table 3, with the full model taking the following form:

.. math:: P=\beta_0+\beta_1*\log{(GDP)}+\beta_2*\log{(Area)}+\beta_3*Curvature+\beta_4*Region+\beta_5*\log{(GDP)}*Region
